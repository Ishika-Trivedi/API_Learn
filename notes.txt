## Through APIs we will fetch, update, insert, delete our data.

## Database Creation and APIs Development:-
* Database Creation
* Table Creation
* APIs Development -> Database connection, request, decision, response
* APIs Testing

## We will do the development of API using PHP which is a
server side language.
For this we need a text editor.

##Firstly, we will add database connection in API.
Now, its time for request.
Whatever kind of data which we send from application to the API and the operations
are performed on that data. This data is called request.

## We will use either GET[] or POST[] method for request.
Format is $name = $_POST[];
In brackets we give the names which we will send the data from postman during testing.

## After the request, we will go for decision. For that we will write a query for inserting data.
After writing query, we will go for the response. For that we will first give a variable result and
store the query result.

## For response, we will check the response by if-else statement.
And then display using echo. This will only show result in string.
We should know that the API response should always be in JSON.
echo json_encode($response)

## For API Testing, we will use postman.
Whatever APIs we are writing, we save it in C drive only.
In C drive, we will find xampp then htdocs and api then paste.
